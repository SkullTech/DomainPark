Program that simplifies Domain Parking

## Note

I built this app as a freelance contract for Fred Lusky of [Sendwell](http://www.sendwell.com/) â€” integrating [Alpnames](https://www.alpnames.com/), [Rookmedia](https://www.rookmedia.net/) and [Parkingcrew](https://www.parkingcrew.com/) APIs to simplify the workflow of domain parking. But as you can see from the commits, it was a looong time ago. I don't have any reason to continue development on this, so I'm archiving this. If you need this repo un-archived, for whatever reason that might be, send me an email.
